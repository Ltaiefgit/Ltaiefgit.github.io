## Welcome to my data science portfolio

I am a computer science student with passion for using data to solve real-world problems. 

Some of my past projects include:
  Predicting film rating using a 10 Million entry version of a streaming site called Movielens
  Create a car price prediction model based data from the largest Europe's car markets
  
I have a strong background in machine learning and statistical modeling, and I am skilled in using a variety of tools and technologies, including Python, R, and actually learning SQL.


In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and enjoy working in cross-functional teams to translate complex data analyses into actionable insights.

Thank you for visiting my page. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project.
